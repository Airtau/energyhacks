Optic Pulse Sensor

Use a NE567 to drive the LED of an optocoupler and detect corresponding reflections.

This schematics is set up corresponding to the many standard layouts to build a light barrier.
The frequency of the 567's oscillator is set to around 4 kHz, enough to prevent stray light
irritations.
