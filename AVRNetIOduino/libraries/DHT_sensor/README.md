This is an Arduino library for the DHT series of low cost temperature/humidity sensors. 

When downloaded, check that the DHT library folder contains DHT.cpp and DHT.h. Place the DHT library folder in your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if it's your first library. Restart the Arduino IDE.
