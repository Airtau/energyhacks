#DS18x20 to MQTT

This sketch reads the value from a Dallas/Maxim DS18x20 one-wire temperature sensor and sends a corresponding MQTT message to the Fluksometer (or any other) MQTT broker. The temperature sensors are automatically detected using the referred example code - license as provided. 
The result is directly integrated into the panel output provided in the Raspberry section.
