This hack is based on different internet sources to actually use
the Arduino IDE also on a Pollin AVR NetIO board. This enables a
very cheap variant of the Arduino plus Ethernet option.
The bootloader source file is taken from the Arduino 1.0.2 sources
and is enhanced to work also with both an ATmega644P and ATmega32 on
the Pollin AVR NetIO.

Additionally an AVRNetIO board was altered to work with an ATmega644P
on 3.3V only.

Test was successful using the AVRNetIO w/ ATmega32 and 644P and Jean-Claude
Wippler's EtherCard implementation; note to change the select pin of the
ethercard examples from default 8 to 4 (PB4 - or use the global variable SS).

There are surely different sources that did the same adaptation already;
but after fiddling two days with the Sanguino bootloader code and not
succeeding (device ID not read?!), I tried to enhance the original Arduino
bootloader from scratch and by that learn about its behavior.

Put the /AVRNetIO/ folder into the Arduino's hardware folder; use a LED on the
J11 jumper header to see bootloader activity.

See the /AVRNetIO_rbbb_server/ for an easy webserver enabling switching Outputs
1 to 8, getting Inputs 1 to 4, and readings from ADC 1 to 4.

For an ATmega644P use following fuse settings:
* Fuse HIGH - 0xDC (JTAG disable, Bootloader active with size 1024 words)
* Fuse LOW - 0xE0 (No clock divider, external clock source for feeding from ENC28J60)
* Fuse Extended - 0xFF (default setting)

The code is under the given sources license.
