This hack uses different internet sources (Arduino.cc, Sanguino.cc, ...)
to actually use the Arduino IDE also on a Pollin AVR NetIO board. This
enables a very cheap variant of the Arduino plus Ethernet option.
The bootloader source file is taken from the Arduino 1.0.2 sources
and is enhanced to work also with both an ATmega644P and ATmega32 on
the Pollin AVR NetIO.

Test was successful using the Sanguino w/ ATmega644P and Jean-Claude
Wippler's EtherCard implementation; not to change the select pin of the
ethercard examples from default 8 to 4 (PB4).

There are surely different sources that did the adaptation already;
but after fiddling two days with the Sanguino bootloader code and not
succeeding, I tried to enhance the original Arduino bootloader from
scratch and by that learn about its behavior.

The code is under the given sources license.
