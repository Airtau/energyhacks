This hack is based on different internet sources to actually use
the Arduino IDE also on a Pollin AVR NetIO board. This enables a
very cheap variant of the Arduino plus Ethernet option.
The bootloader source file is taken from the Arduino 1.0.2 sources
and is enhanced to work also with both an ATmega644P and ATmega32 on
the Pollin AVR NetIO.

Test was successful using the AVRNetIO w/ ATmega644P and Jean-Claude
Wippler's EtherCard implementation; note to change the select pin of the
ethercard examples from default 8 to 4 (PB4 - or use the global variable SS).

There are surely different sources that did the same adaptation already;
but after fiddling two days with the Sanguino bootloader code and not
succeeding (device ID not read?!), I tried to enhance the original Arduino
bootloader from scratch and by that learn about its behavior.

Put the AVRNetIO folder into the Arduino's hardware folder.

The code is under the given sources license.
