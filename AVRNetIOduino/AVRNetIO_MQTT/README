This is a simple sketch to use an Arduino (or the Arduinofied Pollin AVR NetIO)
as MQTT publisher.
It uses an EN28J60 ethernet library compatible to the original Arduino ethernet
library - so they should easily be replaceable.
For the MQTT protocol "knolleary's" PubSubClient library is used; take the URLs
in the source code to download them and put into the Arduino IDE's library folder.

The rest of the source should be self-explaining; it basically reads four analog
ports and detects via INT0 the frequency of an attached AC signal (please don't
use the mains directly ;-))
