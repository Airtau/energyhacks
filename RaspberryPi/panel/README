An MQTT-panel adaptation to the flukso.net Fluksometer.
"serve_mqtt.js" is a JavaScript running on node.js that serves as
a MQTT message to socket.io pipe with an integrated simple http
server serving a page displaying FLM sensor data, that is up to
five gauges received via MQTT messages.
To run the script install node.js; easiest via github.com/joyent/node.
Checkout v0.10.25-release and make. Install the MQTT ans socket.io modules
with npm.
On a running node.js installation just run the ./run.sh script to start
the server - be aware to adapt the MQTT client in the serve_mqtt.js
to your local FLM's address.
Point your whereever located browser to the RasPi's IP address port 1080.
Have fun and sometime also color ;-)
