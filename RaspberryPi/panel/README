An MQTT-panel adaptation to the flukso.net Fluksometer.
"serve_mqtt.js" is a JavaScript running on node.js. It serves as
a MQTT message to socket.io pipe with an integrated simple http
server. The provided page displays data of all connected FLM sensors.
It computes up to five gauges received via MQTT messages.

How to use
==========
To run the script install node.js; easiest from http://github.com/joyent/node.
Checkout v0.10.25-release, make and (sudo) make install.
Install the MQTT and socket.io modules with "npm install mqtt socket.io".
On a running node.js installation just run the ./run.sh script to start
the server - be aware to adapt the MQTT client address in the serve_mqtt.js
to your local FLM's address as well as the socket.io's address in the
index.html.
Point your whereever located browser to the RasPi's IP address port 1080.
Have fun.
