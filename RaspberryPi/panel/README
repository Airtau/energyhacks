An MQTT-panel adaptation to the flukso.net Fluksometer.
"serve_mqtt.js" is a JavaScript running on node.js. It serves as
a MQTT message to socket.io pipe with an integrated simple http
server. The provided page (index.html) displays data of all retrieved
FLM sensor gauges; the index_new.html includes the counters also.

How to use
==========
To run the script install node.js; easiest from http://github.com/joyent/node.
Checkout v0.10.26-release, ./configure,  make and (sudo) make install.
Install the MQTT and socket.io modules with "npm install mqtt socket.io".
On a running node.js installation just run the ./run.sh script to start
the server - be aware to adapt the MQTT client address in the serve_mqtt.js
to your local FLM's address.
Point your wherever located browser to the web server's IP address port 1080,
in my example http://192.168.0.70:1080 - the index.html page is loaded
automatically; for the index_new.html file use http://<address>:1080/index_new.html
Have fun.

The persist_mqtt.js file denotes the starting point to pipe received sensor data
into an mysql database; for this, please also refer to the RaspberryPi/FLMtoDB folder
