This file briefly explains installing mySQL with python access and mosquitto
to run the flm_*_to_db.py scripts.

1) sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

This installs the database and all dependent packages not already installed.
During installation you are asked for a root password of the database; I chose
'raspberry' for this (as a no-brainer to the default wheezy password)

2) sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb python-dev

This installs the python 2 modules to access the database; currently only 
python 2 seems to be working?!

3) wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
   sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
   cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
   sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-wheezy.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients python-mosquitto
   sudo /etc/init.d/mosquitto stop
   
Follow http://mosquitto.org/2013/01/mosquitto-debian-repository/ to install
mosquitto, the MQTT infrastructure; alternatively have a look at the nice
description at http://jpmens.net/2013/09/01/installing-mosquitto-on-a-raspberry-pi/   
   
4) mysql -u root -p
   create database flm;

Log into the database as root; provide above given password when asked.
Create the database used in the logging scripts; chose whatever you like, but
be sure to have the same database applied also in the scripts. Log out of the 
database with quit; (don't forget the semicolon)

Now you are able to run the scripts and store sensor data in the flm database.
Be sure to have changed the sensor IDs to your own ones.

--> nohup python <script>.py &

Use the nohup to keep the script running also when logged out of the RasPi
(I access the RasPi remotely via SSH)

5) mysql -u root -p flm
   show tables;
   select * from flmdata;
   
Access the database and look at the stored data; you may pass the stored data also
to a .csv file using following SQL query

   select *
   into outfile 'flmdata.csv'
   fields terminated by ','
   lines terminated by '\n'
   from flmdata;
