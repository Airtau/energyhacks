This folder contains some programs and scripts to be used on a Raspberry Pi.
First hack is a Python script to read local Fluksometer [www.flukso.net] data
and store this in a MySQL database for later assessment.

*.psp are python server page files to be deployed into the web server
directory of the Raspberry Pi. That is /var/www for Apache; look for
further details on how to use python for web page display in, for
example http://webpython.codepoint.net

I use the functionality of http://www.flotcharts.org  to display the data
graphically.

*.py is the python file to read FLM measurement from the local API; to be
deployed wherever convenient on the RaspPi, for example /home/pi/Python
