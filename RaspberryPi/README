This folder contains some programs and scripts (in own folders) to be used
on a Raspberry Pi.
First hack in "FLMtoDB" is a Python script to read local Fluksometer
[www.flukso.net] data and store this in a MySQL database for later assessment.
Second hack in "panel" is an adaptation of the mqtt-panel by FabAff to the FLM.

*.psp are python server page files to be deployed into the web server
directory of the Raspberry Pi. That is /var/www for Apache; look for
further details on how to use python for web page display in, for
example http://webpython.codepoint.net

I use the functionality of http://www.flotcharts.org  to display the data
graphically.

*.py is the python file to read FLM measurement from the local API; to be
deployed wherever convenient on the RaspPi, for example /home/pi/Python

*.js are JavaScript files respectively.
