"Impulsformer" provides a little converter that transforms the current measured by a current clamp (as used by the Fluksometer - see www.flukso.net) to an S0-conformant impulse set, in the example case 1000 impulses per measured kWh.
The basic use of the converter is for the Fluksometer to enhance it by one (or more, as the used microcontroller's ADCs are not fully utilized) analog input.
The given schematics, board and corresponding software are based on an Atmel ATtiny13(A) and just a few external components.
The used voltage converter is a low drop variant capable to be "clamped" to the existing Fluksometer AC/DC module, so not requiring an additional voltage source.
The microcontroller may be driven also with lower Vcc and different operating frequency; the given outline is working fine...
