#Simple MQTT Gauges

This hack is a tiny node.js based web server that subscribes to an MQTT topic from a sensor publisher and displays the received values as gauges.
Actually this is a rip of the Fluksometer display to be found in [gebhardm/flmdisplay](https://github.com/gebhardm/flmdisplay/tree/master/combined)
